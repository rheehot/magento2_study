<p>For the Nike Women's Training Spring 2012 collection, we asked Nike athletes and trainers to examine the way they train and look for the commonalities in their range of motion. Our designers then used innovation and design to develop a collection of footwear and apparel that enhances each one of the 6 CORE MOVES by providing zero distraction and technological details that are hidden in the beauty of a unique design aesthetic.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape. An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

<p>The tight, seamless fit helps support the muscles and flatters the figure. At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>Skinny adjustable elastic straps, pulled into a racer back arrangement, free up the shoulders for the maximum range of arm movements. Smart touches minimize irritation: the neckline and armholes are hemmed with a soft elastic binding and side seams moved further round towards the back of the bra. Support is provided by a lined internal shelf bra, which works in conjunction with the adjustable straps, making the Nike Indy Strappy Bra ideal for low-impact training. The Nike Indy Reversible Strappy Bra comes in a range of bold colors with a large swoosh on the reverse side, making it a fun and comfortable workout choice.</p>

<p>The main front body is made of soft Dri-FIT stretch jersey fabric (cotton, polyester and spandex mix) and the reverse of Dri-FIT mesh (polyester and spandex) for extra ventilation. The racer-style back is generously scooped out for fluid curves (picked out by the contrasting hem), slim straps and maximum freedom for the shoulders during moves such as push and pull as well as when rotating. A mesh back ventilation panel, in a contrasting color, accentuates the muscular lines of the bra. Smart touches minimize irritation: the neckline and armholes are hemmed with a soft elastic binding and side seams moved further round towards the back of the bra. The snug-fitting lined internal shelf bra offers invisible light support for low-impact training.</p>

<p>These eye-catching shorts consist of two layers, which work together for comfort, freedom of movement, and sweat management. The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

<p>A flattering V-neck top that creates an elegant slimline silhouette. The Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix) hugs the body but also wicks sweat away from the skin keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. The positioning of the side seams keeps the top streamline and simple and the longer body not only elongates the look, but also keeps your rear covered when you Bend or Squat. Raglan sleeves allow arms and shoulders to move freely in moves such as the Pull while an underarm gusset and flat seam keep you comfortable. Tops come in an extensive range of block colors, with a subtle Nike swoosh on the breast. Attractive on its own, this slim-fit top is also great for layering with a jacket or team uniform.</p>

"Learning to Love Again",learning-to-love-again,outdoor,,"<p><span>When I began the trail, I knew that I would miss the regular physical contact that I had with people in sedentary life. Everything from high fives, fist bumps, hugs, and handshakes &ndash; I would miss it all. Little did I know how strange and how hard it would be to feel love without that simple physical contact. Disclaimer &ndash; you might want to read up on the 5 love languages if you&rsquo;re slightly confused about what I am talking about. </span></p>
<p><span>A simple Google search should suffice. While on trail, besides ticks and bears, the thing that hikers fear most is Norovirus &ndash; imagine having a stomach bug for three days and not being able to eat anything while losing it all. Being a virus, it is spread through human contact with anyone or anything that is infected or has come into contact with it. For this reason, among others, you don&rsquo;t shake hands, high five, fist bump, give hugs, and you make sure to actively avoid contact if possible. Being someone who feels love through those simple interactions, it was so strange for me to not shake people&rsquo;s hands when I met them or to congratulate people with hugs or high fives. </span></p>
<p><span>It felt was as though I was being isolated from people even though I was in close proximity with them every day. The good news is that physical contact isn&rsquo;t the only love language. I found myself trying to love others and to be loved in ways that were not my primary languages. Whenever someone did trail magic, not only did I feel overjoyed, but there was a deeper sense of appreciation and gratitude that made me feel cared for and loved. If someone threw my bear line for me, I would feel the same thing &ndash; something deeper than service and gifts.</span></p>
<p><span> I see how the other love languages are more active in my life and think about how the trail isn&rsquo;t just teaching my legs how to do big miles, or my brain to spend time in silence and though, but that it is changing me. It is changing the way that I can be loved and how I can adapt to be loved in almost every situation. As someone wise once wrote, &ldquo;these three remain &ndash; faith, hope, and love, but the greatest of these is love&rdquo;.</span></p>",wysiwyg/blog/blog02.jpg,,"When I began the trail, I knew that I would miss the regular physical contact that I had with people in sedentary life.

Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it’s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won’t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>
<p>Nike Seamless long bra</p>
<p>A seamless skin that maximizes breathability and sweat management while minimizing chaffing, irritation or chunky straps that might impede movement.</p>
<p>It’s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape. An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing.

You know the sort of scenario: suspicions raised when the tooth fairy forgets to come, or St Nicholas commits a wrapping-paper infraction visible only to a nosey eight-year-old.</p>
<p>Or when, as happened this week, it turns out that the big brands we know and trust have been having a giggle behind our backs. Ahead of an official report into misleading offers, a number of our leading supermarkets have announced they are to discontinue multi-buy deals. It turns out that bogofs &ndash; buy one, get one free offers &ndash; are a false economy, making us fork out on average over &pound;1,000 more a year than we planned. A supermarket aisle Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Ocado were all found to be offering misleading deals CREDIT: ALAMY I wish I had filmed my teenage daughter at the moment she discovered that the supermarket (OUR supermarket!) had been tricking us! Us! Its loyal customers! Who shop there all the time! The conversation went something like this. Me: &ldquo;Can you fetch me a pack of mushrooms, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her: &ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; dropping carton into the trolley. Me: &ldquo;Not those ones, the others are cheaper.&rdquo; Her: &ldquo;Durr, no they&rsquo;re not. Compare the prices?&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;Durr, compare the weights? And then compare the prices?&rdquo; Shopping trolley with food in it Buy one get one free deals cause shoppers to spend &pound;1000 more a year than they planned.

Off.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, darling, it&rsquo;s not almost like that,&rdquo; I soothed. &ldquo;It is exactly like that.&rdquo; ""While there is no suggestion that Google has broken any law by paying such frankly trivial back taxes, it highlights that the law is too complex, and that it allows too much wriggle room."" &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not fai-ai-air!&rdquo; she wailed.</p>

The Object Recognition Scanner (ORS) works by utilizing pattern and color recognition technology being developed by the company.</p>
<p><a href=""http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/object-recognition-scanner-2-1440x916.jpg?ver=1""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-338290"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" src=""http://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/object-recognition-scanner-2-625x397.jpg?ver=1"" alt="""" width=""625"" height=""397"" /></a></p>
<p><a href=""http://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/object-recognition-scanner-2-1440x916.jpg?ver=1""></a>Toshiba&rsquo;s Keiichi Hasegawa explained that although the special scanner is able to recognize any supermarket item, it will be particularly useful when it comes to fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fruit and vegetables in supermarkets don&rsquo;t usually have bar codes because they&rsquo;re put out while they&rsquo;re fresh, so these items can&rsquo;t be read at the register using bar codes, which means staff need to input data to record them,&rdquo; Hasegawa said. &ldquo;If staff are part-time employees, they may not recognize some items, which can cause delays. We&rsquo;re developing this new scanner to solve that problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The technology is so advanced that it goes well beyond simply telling the difference between an apple and an orange. Toshiba&rsquo;s Object Recognition Scanner can tell your Red Delicious from your Pacific Rose, and your Cortland from your Wealthy &mdash; great news if you work in a supermarket and don&rsquo;t happen to be an apple aficionado.</p>
<p>Toshiba is currently in the process of creating a database of typical supermarket items and is also fine tuning the scanner so that it will avoid causing any of those long, drawn-out item-waving moments.</p>",wysiwyg/blog/supermarket_2.jpg,,"We all get stuck at the supermarket checkout from time to time when the assistant can’t get an item’s bar code to scan. We’re left watching in awkward silence as the flustered employee waves the item every which way, upside down, back and forth, at an angle, until they’re left literally rubbing it on the scanner in the vain hope that the machine will do us all a favor, recognize that it’s a loaf of bread and beep.",1

"What's New on Your Supermarket Shelf?",what_s_new_on_your_supermarket,grocery-gourmet,,"Health, convenience prime concerns for consumers

Last year's hottest supermarket craze -- low-carb products -- can be found in this year's clearance aisle. In a country obsessed with dieting, we've seen low-fat, fat-free, sugar-free, low-carb, and no-carb foods come and go with little impact on our girth. In fact, as a nation, we're heavier than ever.

So what new foods can you expect to see next on your supermarket shelves? WebMD asked the experts for their predictions on the latest trends.

As with most everything else, baby boomers are affecting how the nation eats, according to the NPD Marketing group. Boomers made their mark with fast food in the '60s, fern bars in the '70s, microwaves in the '80s, take-out in the '90s, and a trend toward healthier foods today, according to Harry Balzar, NPD's vice president. As the boomers age, they are coping with health and weight concerns that drive their eating patterns.

But boomers aren't the only ones behind changes in food buying habits.

""Increasing Latin populations have had an enormous impact on our food trends,"" says supermarket guru Phil Lempert, editor of the Facts, Figures and the Future newsletter. ""They don't drink sodas with high-fructose corn syrup, and their diets are more abundant in fruits, vegetables, and fresh foods.""",wysiwyg/blog/gro-blog01.jpg,,"Last year's hottest supermarket craze -- low-carb products -- can be found in this year's clearance aisle.

<p>Good nutrition starts with smart choices in the grocery store. Cooking up healthy meals is a challenge if you don't have the right ingredients in your kitchen.</p>
<p>But who has time to read all the food labels and figure out which items are the most nutritious and the best buys? Grocery shopping can be a daunting task, simply because there are so many choices.</p>
<p>""Markets perform a great public service, but keep in mind they are designed to get you to buy (and, therefore, eat) more food, not less,"" says Marion Nestle, PhD, MPH, professor of nutrition at New York University and author of What to Eat: An Aisle-by-Aisle Guide to Savvy Food Choices and Good Eating.</p>

<p>Plan Ahead for Success<br />The process starts even before you head to the grocery store, experts say. Before you set out for the market, plan your meals for the week, and create a list to shop from. It takes a few minutes, but saves time in running back to the store for missing ingredients.</p>

"9 Healthy Foods for a Diet-Friendly Fridge",healthy_foods_for_diet,grocery-gourmet,,"<p>Must-have items for quick, healthy snacks and meals.</p>
<p>How many times do you open your refrigerator door each day, peering in and hoping to be inspired? It stands to reason that if you keep your refrigerator stocked with appetizing foods that also happen to be good for you, you're much more likely to eat healthy meals and healthy snacks.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that the ""out of sight, out of mind"" principle applies to your fridge. Many of us, for example, have colorful fruits and vegetables on hand -- but keep them buried in the crisper drawers at the bottom of the fridge. You are more likely to see, eat, and enjoy healthy foods if they're in a ready-to-eat form, staring at you from the eye-level shelves in your refrigerator.</p>
<p>Here are nine must-have healthy foods for a diet-friendly refrigerator:</p>
<p>1. Fruit Salad<br />Take that fruit from your crisper and fruit bowl and turn it into a tasty fruit salad, drizzled with a high-vitamin-C fruit juice (to keep the fruit from browning), and packed in a see-through, covered container. You might also find bags of pre-sliced organic apples in your market that you can keep front and center in your fridge.</p>
<p>2. Crunchy Raw Vegetables<br />Try cucumbers, celery, zucchini, jicama, and carrots, cut into sticks or slices, rinsed, and kept in a see-through covered container.</p>
<p>3. Ready-to-Eat Green Salad<br />A salad made with high-nutrient spinach or romaine lettuce, and embellished with cherry tomatoes, beans, and even nuts, is more likely to be gobbled once liberated from the crisper. Looking for a healthy meal in seconds flat? This salad can quickly transform into an entree with the addition of grilled chicken breast, cooked shrimp, or lean steak slices.</p>
<p>4. Whole-Wheat Pita Pockets and/or Tortillas<br />Switching from refined (or white) grain products to whole grains is one of the most powerful dietary changes you can make. Research has suggested that eating plenty of whole grains may lead to an assortment of health benefits, including lengthening your life span, helping with weight control, and reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and some cancers.</p>
<p>Keeping a pack of whole-wheat pita pockets or whole-grain tortillas in the refrigerator can inspire quite a few quick, healthy meals or snacks. The pita or tortilla can serve as a base for quesadillas, pizzas, and hot or cold sandwiches or wraps. These items tend to get moldy fairly quickly at room temperature, but will last at least a week in the refrigerator.</p>",wysiwyg/blog/gro-blog03.jpg,,"Take that fruit from your crisper and fruit bowl and turn it into a tasty fruit salad, drizzled with a high-vitamin-C fruit juice (to keep the fruit from browning), and packed in a see-through, covered container.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>BNKR: What&rsquo;s the key to keeping your hair looking fresh and healthy in 2016?</strong><br /> </span><strong>Kevin Murphy:</strong> 2016 is the year of the haircut. In the past it&rsquo;s been about the colour or the texture, this year it&rsquo;s the year to think about the length of your hair. &lsquo;Is my hair length cool anymore?&rsquo; is the question you need to ask right now.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Which haircut will we be seeing everywhere this season?</strong><br /> </span>This coming season it&rsquo;s all about the shag &ndash; loose natural texture with volume.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What is the new on the block &lsquo;must have&rsquo; hair product that every girl should have in their cupboard?</strong><br /> </span><a href=""http://kevinmurphy.com.au/product/doo-over/"" target=""_blank"">KEVIN.MURPHY DOO.OVER</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a hybrid product, part finishing spray part dry shampoo; it&rsquo;s great for texture and volume and to enhance or transform any look.</p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>What hair trend will we see the end of in 2016?<br /> </strong>Natural looking texture and shaggy hair that has volume on top.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>Will headbands really be making a comeback this year?</strong><br /> </span>Only when you have to pull back your natural texture &ndash; the headband makes unruly hair look acceptable, pulling frizzy or textured hair back makes a more chic statement.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>The SS16 runways saw a lot of &lsquo;wet look&rsquo; hair &ndash; will that still be a big trend this year?</strong><br /> </span>I think that catwalks are more about fantasy than reality, we can take ideas from a catwalk but it&rsquo;s not really expected that we would walk around looking like that. We might look at wet hair on a catwalk but we could interpret that as defined or separated look for hair for the street. &lsquo;Wet look&rsquo; may mean a making your product a little more prominent &ndash; and you need to have the complete look to pull it off, the hair, the shoes, the outfit&hellip;</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What is your number one tip to getting &lsquo;cool girl&rsquo; hair?</strong><br /> </span>Be yourself.&nbsp;As Diana Vreeland said, &ldquo;Get a look and stick to it.&rdquo; Fashion these days is about embracing your own personal style &ndash; find what works for you. We can&rsquo;t all be &lsquo;it girls&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s okay, but we should try and own what we have; embrace yourself. Don&rsquo;t stray too far from who you are naturally &ndash; in colour and texture &ndash; and you will look cool. Once you start trying too hard you lose who you are and then you become a stranger from yourself. Listen to Diana, she knows best.</p>

"How To: Deal With Life As An Awkward Panda",westyle08,westylefashion,,"<p>Literally every day is a struggle for me. I&rsquo;m not depressed, I don&rsquo;t have an abusive home life, I haven&rsquo;t suffered any unimaginable trauma. None of these things apply to me. Life is just that little bit more difficult for me because, well, I&rsquo;m a bit special.</p>
<p>In the time it takes me to get from home to work in the morning, I will have already suffered through a series of clumsy, forgetful, ridiculous events which will continue throughout my day, everyday. In all other respects I&rsquo;m a normal functioning member of society, it just tends to take me a little longer to get from A to B.</p>
<p>To combat this I have to keep my wardrobe easy. Not&nbsp;basic, just simple enough that I don&rsquo;t have to spend time fussing around.

"When Frank Ocean Floats Your Boat…But His New Album Doesn’t.",westyle11,westylefashion,"When Frank Ocean Floats Your Boat…But His New Album Doesn’t","<p>Put away your pitchforks and blow torches. I&rsquo;m not about to bag it. I&rsquo;m just feeling a little conflicted. In 2012 Frank Ocean dropped&nbsp;<em>Channel Orange&nbsp;</em>and had me completely captivated. It was soulful, progressive and musically interesting (something we lack so much of these days). It would not be exaggerating to estimate that I have listened to the whole thing, start to finish, upwards of&nbsp;100 times since its release. And I&rsquo;m still not over it.</p>
<p>So&nbsp;imagine my anticipation when, after all the teasers and false alarms, we finally get&nbsp;two new album drops, in the space of two days:&nbsp;<em>Blond</em>&nbsp;and visual album&nbsp;<em>Endless</em>. Of course I couldn&rsquo;t remember my Apple ID password. Devastating. Had to create a whole new account before I could listen. But that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p><span class=""aligncenter""><a href=""http://blog.fashionbunker.com/content/uploads/2016/08/Frank-Ocean-Blonde-e1472028227348.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-8178 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.fashionbunker.com/content/uploads/2016/08/Frank-Ocean-Blonde-e1472028227348.jpg"" alt=""Frank-Ocean-Blonde"" width=""560"" height=""560"" /></a></span></p>
<p><em>Blond</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Blonde</em>&nbsp;(depending on who&nbsp;you&nbsp;ask) failed to grab my attention on the first listen. But that&rsquo;s fair, hardly any album does. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that any album deserves three full listens before passing judgment. I listened six times and still couldn&rsquo;t seem to form any kind of emotional attachment. It&nbsp;felt more like ambient pop than music of the soul. Not unpleasant but not memorable and not expected.</p>
<p><span class=""aligncenter""><a href=""http://blog.fashionbunker.com/content/uploads/2016/08/frank-ocean-endless-01-960x640.0.0-e1472028261383.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-8179 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.fashionbunker.com/content/uploads/2016/08/frank-ocean-endless-01-960x640.0.0-e1472028261383.jpg"" alt=""frank-ocean-endless-01-960x640.0.0"" width=""560"" height=""374"" /></a></span></p>
<p><em>Endless</em>&nbsp;&ndash; the visual album &ndash; is visually unexciting. The black and white film set in a warehouse shows&nbsp;Ocean working away, building what appears to be a spiral staircase. This continues for the duration of the album with very few changes even to the camera angle. It feels arty but not at all&nbsp;integral to the album. Stylistically and vocally&nbsp;<em>Endless</em>&nbsp;is similar to&nbsp;<em>Channel Orange.&nbsp;</em>Featuring a very long and impressive list of &lsquo;contributors&rsquo;, there&rsquo;s no denying that there are some pockets during the 45 minute album which provide the feels that a Frank Ocean album should &ndash; but you spend a long time waiting for them.</p>
<p>I realise change is&nbsp;important and experimentation is necessary for an&nbsp;artist to&nbsp;grow. I also&nbsp;realise&nbsp;Frank wasn&rsquo;t thinking purely of me and my wishes in the process of creating his life&rsquo;s work. I will also admit both albums have some great moments and are definitely worth a listen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really my own fault; I&rsquo;ve come into the experience tainted. The truth is, when you come across an album you connect with in such a way that you would&nbsp;name your first born after it, no follow-up album &ndash; no matter how good &ndash; will ever compare.</p>
<p><span class=""aligncenter""><a href=""http://blog.fashionbunker.com/content/uploads/2016/08/200_s.gif""><img class=""wp-image-8181 size-full aligncenter"" src=""http://blog.fashionbunker.com/content/uploads/2016/08/200_s.gif"" alt="" "" width=""266"" height=""200"" /></a></span></p>
<p>To put it simply, if you felt the way I did about&nbsp;<em>Channel Orange,&nbsp;</em>you probably won&rsquo;t like&nbsp;<em>Blond</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Endless</em>&nbsp;very much.

"It’s Halloween Jewelry Time!",it_s_halloween_jewelry_time,westyle-jewelry,,"You know what I like about October? Halloween. And you know what I like about Halloween? It gives me an excuse to repost this gif starring my hockey mask and chainsaw earrings. (The gif was created by the fine folks at Spring, the Instagram-like shopping app.)

The combination of a hockey mask and a chainsaw has come to be a recognizable reference to movie serial killers, even though it muddles together two different horror flicks. As I wrote in 2014 when I introduced the earrings, the character of Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th movies wore a hockey mask but wielded a machete. The chainsaw belongs to Leatherface of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series. Leatherface does wear masks, but his are made of human skin. But the Jason/Leatherface blend of killer accessories dates back at least to 1993, when The Simpsons used it in its “Cape Feare” episode.


You can see how the earrings look on here.

If you’re not into slasher movies, I’ve got skull jewelry (for every budget) that’s appropriate for Halloween and the rest of the year too. I certainly wear it all year round! I’m putting a few pieces on sale for the holiday. Check them out now, because these prices will be available for a limited time.

My 18K gold Juana skull pieces were inspired by Juana la Loca, a princess of Spain born in the 15th century. Read all about her here.

"What’s Irreplaceable",what_s_irreplaceable,westyle-jewelry,,"The reports of the armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris — with millions of dollars of jewelry stolen — reminded me of advice my late business partner used to give to customers.

Always insure your jewelry, she would tell people who were nervous about getting a sizable diamond. If (“God forbid!” she’d exclaim) you’re threatened with physical harm, give up the jewelry without hesitation. Keep yourself safe. File a police report. Then, she’d say, if the jewelry can’t be recovered, “We’ll use the insurance money to make you a bigger and better ring.”

Kim might be an exception when it comes to that last step — at least when it comes to engagement-ring diamonds — it’s difficult to go bigger than Kim’s 20-carat Lorraine Schwartz ring and still have the use of one’s hand.

However, she could go from a skinny band to something more substantial.

But that’s not important right now! No one — including Kim — should spend too much time mourning for jewelry. I admit that it can be hard to let go because jewelry is an unusually meaningful possession. (That’s what I like about it.) It’s often purchased to mark a special occasion: a graduation, an engagement, a marriage, the addition of a child to your family. It gets passed down from generation to generation. You expect that your good pieces will go to someone important to you, and be important to them too.

Like diamond connoisseur Elizabeth Taylor said to — guess who? — Kim Kardashian in 2011, “Size does matter, but so does the size of the emotion behind it.” Elizabeth had big diamonds and big emotions in her life. The fifth and sixth of her eight husbands — actor Richard Burton (the passionate couple divorced, remarried, and divorced again) — bought her a 69.42-carat pear-shaped diamond that she wore in a necklace to the Oscars in 1970.",wysiwyg/blog/wsjew-blog5.jpg,,"The reports of the armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris — with millions of dollars of jewelry stolen — reminded me of advice my late business partner used to give to customers.",1

The trick to scoring a one-piece that flatters a larger chest is simple: choose a swimsuit with underwire.

For all you pears out there, your hips are the widest part of your body which is why you look great in higher-cut sides so they don't pinch your hips, while a halter top will give the chest more emphasis and draws the attention towards your waist. Hourglasses you should highlight your shape with retro suits - think Bardot in a high-waisted gingham two-piece.</p>

<p>his keen sense of understated elegance, Belgian architect <a href=""http://www.ns-architects.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Nicholas Schuybroek</a> began his career in Canada before returning to Antwerp to work alongside renowned designer Vincent Van Duysen. A few years later, in 2011 Schuybroek struck out on his own – establishing his eponymous firm and distinct brand of minimal yet soulfully warm design. In the years since, the architect/designer has turned out an array of projects ranging from houses on the Cote d’Azur, and hotels in Chicago, to offices in Belgium and high design home accessories. His finely tuned sense of balance, space, and material have won Schuybroek international accolades, including a spot on AD France’s top 100 Designers in 2013, 2015, and 2017. If you’ve yet to acquaint yourself with his enviable aesthetic, this Paris apartment just may be the perfect first peek into his beautiful world…</p>

<p class=""theBad""><strong>The Bad</strong> This phone has the same pedestrian design, missing headphone jack and battery life as the iPhone 7 -- and no dual camera either. The iPhone 8 costs a bit more than baseline new iPhones in years past, and comes only in black, silver and a new shade of gold.</p>
<p class=""theBottomLine""><strong>The Bottom Line</strong> <span id=""seodescription"" class=""description"">The sensible, speedy iPhone 8 makes a nice upgrade to the iPhone 6S and earlier siblings, but we won't know until November how it compares to the much pricier iPhone X.</span></p>
<p class=""theBottomLine""></p>
<p>On Nov. 3,  Apple will roll out its seductive sports car of a phone: the all-new, totally redesigned, edgy, giant-screened <span class=""link""><a href=""#"">iPhone X</a></span>.</p>
<p>So why buy an iPhone 8 when that sexy iPhone X is just around the corner? The 8 is last year's design with this year's technology. It feels familiar. It's a safe pick. It's a ""let's not spend a thousand dollars on an iPhone"" iPhone. It's a ""Touch ID and a home button matter more to me than a leap of faith into the world of Face ID"" iPhone.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/blog/tech-blog02.jpg""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>Make no mistake: The iPhone 8 is essentially the ""iPhone 7S."" Apple saved the cool features and radical new design for the iPhone X, which costs 43 percent more -- $999, £999 or AU$1,579 to start. And if you want the truly impressive dual camera, with portrait mode and 2x optical zoom -- both seriously nice step-ups -- you'll need to invest in the much larger <a href=""#"" data-annotation=""true"" data-component=""linkTracker"" data-link-tracker-options=""{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;inline-annotation|Apple iPhone 8 Plus|CNET_FAM_SERIES|402&quot;}"">iPhone 8 Plus</a><span> (<a class=""inlineAnnotation"" href=""#"">$981.00 at Amazon.com</a>)</span>, or wait for that eventual X. It's a different approach than Samsung, which made its whole line of <span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Galaxy S8</a></span> and <span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Note 8</a></span> phones look new, but not too dissimilar from Google's take on the <span class=""link""><a href=""#"">Pixel 2 phones</a></span>. With the iPhone, new looks only come at the top end.</p>
<p>That X is tempting indeed, but my only real-world experience with the device is the brief time I spent with it at Apple's Sept. 12 launch event. Until I can eventually get one and put it through its paces, I strongly recommend that you refrain from buying any phone whatsoever.</p>
<p>But if you need a phone right now, or if you have no desire to pay the iPhone X premium, let's talk practical considerations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The iPhone 8's best feature is its processor, a fast new six-core A11 Bionic chip, similar to the processor in the iPhone X and 8 Plus. Thanks to an all-new image sensor, photo quality has improved in low light, as has video quality. The iPhone 8 adds an improved iPad-style True Tone screen, and the speakers sound nice and loud. All the new iPhones include wireless charging now, thanks to a glass back.</p>
<p>If you have an <span class=""link""><a href=""#"">iPhone 7</a></span>, you'll find the faster speed, better screen and better camera on the iPhone 8 ""nice to have,"" but short of ""must-buy"" territory -- unless you're particularly enamored with the wireless charging Android owners have enjoyed for years.</p>
<p>For anyone with an <a href=""#"" data-annotation=""true"" data-component=""linkTracker"" data-link-tracker-options=""{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;inline-annotation|Apple iPhone 6S|CNET_FAM_SERIES|606&quot;}"">iPhone 6S</a><span> (<a class=""inlineAnnotation"" href=""#"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" data-component=""leadsTracker"" data-leads-tracker-options=""{&quot;numNodes&quot;:3}"">$595.00 at Amazon.com</a>)</span> or previous model, however, the benefits of jumping to an iPhone 8 ramp up dramatically. The speed, screen, audio and camera improvements will feel significant, and you'll get nice upgrades you missed when you skipped the iPhone 7, including water resistance.</p>
<p>So, yeah: That iPhone X may look great in the showroom window. But ultimately, you're driving off the lot with the practical four-door crossover. It's more affordable. It gets perfectly decent gas mileage. But it still has the same nice high-end navigation package, entertainment system and fuel-injected engine as that sweet low-slung coupe. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>That's the iPhone 8. The baseline 2017 iPhone remains a top-tier smartphone -- a seriously good phone. Just don't expect it to turn heads.</p>

"Panasonic Lumix DC-GX9 First Impressions Review",panasonic-lumix-dc-gx9-first-impressions-review,hightech,,"<p>The Panasonic Lumix DC-GX9 is a rangefinder-style Micro Four Thirds camera whose most recognizable feature is its tilting electronic viewfinder. The GX9 provides a healthy serving of new features and performance improvements over its predecessor, the GX8.</p>
<p>The most notable changes include the removal of the low-pass filter on the GX9's 20MP sensor, 5-axis in-body image stabilization (up from 4-axis), slightly faster burst shooting and Bluetooth connectivity. The shutter unit has also been redesigned, with Panasonic claiming a 90% reduction in 'shutter shock' compared to the GX8. There's also a built-in flash - something the GX8 lacked - as well as some tweaks to image processing.</p>
<p>Panasonic appears to have rearranged their lineup a bit, with the GX9 serving more as a midrange model than its predecessors, sitting alongside the DSLR-style DMC-G85. The price has come down to $999 with a kit lens, compared to $1199 for the GX8's body alone. Alongside the price drop, some features found on the GX8 are now gone, such as weather-sealing. The EVF is smaller and battery life has dropped by about 25%, as well.</p>
<p>The GX9's closest peers are the Fujifilm X-E3 and Sony's a6300, both of which have 24MP APS-C sensors, hybrid autofocus systems (which the GX9 lacks) and 4K video capture.</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/blog/blog-camera_02.jpg""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>You can see that the differences between the GX9 and GX8 are a mixed bag. The GX9 loses the low-pass filter, get an extra axis (rotation) of image stabilization and adds Bluetooth and a flash. However, its viewfinder is smaller, body no longer weather-sealed and battery life has taken a turn for the worse. Speaking of viewfinders, Panasonic has gone back to a field sequential panel (a different technology than traditional LCD or OLED,) which some people may find distracting due to 'color tearing'. The LCD is now tilting versus fully articulating, which some people may find as an upgrade, and others will not.</p>
<p>The 20MP Live MOS sensor on the GX8 is as high resolution as you'll find on a Micro Four Thirds camera, though larger APS-C sensors perform a bit better at high sensitivities. Both the X-E3 and a6300 have hybrid (contrast + phase detect) autofocus systems, though Panasonic's DFD system has performed quite well despite lacking phase-detection. The GX8 has higher resolution LCDs and an EVF that's quite a bit bigger than the X-E3's. Both the X-E3 and a6300 have faster burst rates and 35% higher battery life.</p>",magefan_blog/blog-camera.jpg,,,1
"Canon got it right on International Women's Day",canon-got-it-right-on-international-women-day,hightech,,"<p>""For International Women's Day, Canon..."" as I read the subject line of the email, I cringe at the possible endings to that sentence.</p>
<p>Not outside the realm of possibilities is something like, ""Releases Commemorative Pink Camera Strap!"" In 2018 I think we're better than that. Probably. I keep reading.</p>
<p>""...Lends Support to 'Women Photograph'"" is how it ends, and I feel a real sense of relief. This was an organization I knew and had covered in the past. It aims to 'elevate the voices of female visual journalists,' offering an additional resource for editors as well as grants and workshops for female photographers. I read on.</p>
<p>""Canon will work with Women Photograph to aid their travel grant program which funds female and non-binary photographers to attend workshops, hostile environment trainings, festivals, and other developmental opportunities.""</p>
<p><img src=""{{media url=""wysiwyg/blog/blog-camera_08.png""}}"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>If you're a brand looking to grab a slice of the #MeToo pie, you could definitely do much worse than this. Case in point: McDonald's put on a master class this year in getting it wrong. The fast food giant announced that it would be turning its logo upside down to recognize International Women's Day... a ""W"" instead of an ""M""... for women... get it? Critics spoke up quickly, pointing out that it felt like an empty gesture coming from a company that can afford to do much more.</p>
<p>The upside down arches were on my mind when I started reading that press release from Canon this morning, so it felt very reassuring to see the brand pledging real support behind an effort created by, and created for, women photographers. Sure, it's all marketing at the end of the day, and I truly hope Canon's support of Women Photograph doesn't begin and end with a one-time workshop. Issuing a press release is cheap. Following through, and staying committed in the long term isn't.</p>
<p>But if you're going to talk about supporting women on International Women's Day, please don't just give us an empowering logo and a T-shirt. Instead, put your money where your mouth is.</p>",magefan_blog/blog-camera_04.jpg,,,1
"2019 Lexus ES is first mass-produced car to replace side mirrors with cameras",2019-lexus-es-is-first-mass-produced-car-to-replace-side-mirrors-with-cameras,car,,"<p>Concept cars have been trying to replace side mirrors with cameras for decades, and now Lexus is actually going to do it on a production car. There's one important caveat though: It's only for Japan.</p>
<p>First implemented for the recently redesigned (and recently reviewed) 2019 Lexus ES, the side mirrors are being replaced with small, aerodynamic camera stalks. Those small cameras tucked into the stalks provide a constant video feed to five-inch screens placed at the base of the car's A-pillars. The biggest reason manufacturers are pushing this kind of tech is to improve aerodynamics. Swapping those side mirrors out for something much smaller creates less drag, and ultimately, better fuel economy.</p>
<p>Lexus says there are a couple other advantages for going digital here too. For one, the camera modules are able to resist the accumulation of raindrops and snow due to their design. There's also less wind noise since the mirrors cut through the air so well. This will become even more important as silent electric cars trickle their way onto the market. The actual visibility is supposed to be better as well. Lexus says that the view is ""enhanced"" when you activate a turn signal, and helps provide better rearward vision when put into reverse — think Honda LaneWatch, but way cooler.</p>
<p>We won't be seeing this futuristic-looking side mirror technology in the U.S. for some time, because it's still not legal here. The technology is legal to use in Europe, but Lexus says it'll only be offered in Japan for the time being. Audi, though, will be bringing its side camera mirror technology to Europe by the end of the year with the E-Tron. There's still no release date on the electric SUV, but it might be the first to market with the tech on that continent.</p>
<p>Audi wants to bring side mirror camera technology to the U.S. in its E-Tron, but the regulations still need to be changed to allow that here - the E-Tron is expected to be for sale in the U.S. sometime in 2019. Buyers in Japan will be able to scoop a Lexus ES with the tech this October.</p>",magefan_blog/car-blog01.jpg,,,1
"Bentley preps 'Centennary Specification' for all models built in 2019",bentley-preps-centennary-specification-for-all-models-built-in-2019,car,,"<p>For the entirety of Bentley's 100th year in business, the English carmaker will adorn its products with a Centenary Specification. The package consists of unique badging with specially developed Centenary Gold badge highlights, available Centenary Gold thread for the headrest logos, contrast stitching and cross stitching, and a ""centenary welcome light"" outside the vehicle. The in-house craftsmen have also developed unique embroidery.</p>
<p>Bentley says the gold hue was inspired by metalwork on vintage models like the 1919 EXP 2 (pictured, red and silver) and 1929 Birkin Blower (pictured, green), the latter one of the company's Le Mans winners driven by Sir Henry ""Tim"" Birkin. The hue possesses an ""elegant warm tone and a deep fluid shadow."" The steering wheel badge, key fob, shift knob, and wheel center caps feature the tinted ring. The ""B"" badge on the radiator surround also features ""1919-2019"" script, and that script is found on the tread plates, too.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, eponymous founder Walter Owen Bentley's engineering career began with locomotives — which he loved more than cars at one point — and motorcycles, before settling on automobiles. He bought his first car in 1910, a French DFP, and after improving it himself, set a 10-lap record at the Brooklands circuit. In 1912 he opened a DFP franchise with his brother Horace Milner as Bentley &amp; Bentley, and further upgraded the car with a new piston design that was 88 percent aluminum and 12 percent copper. The Royal Naval Air Service adopted Bentley's piston design and Bentley's re-designed Clerget airplane engines, dubbed the Bentley Rotary.</p>
<p>After the war, Bentley refocused on cars, and in 1919 released the 3-Litre, which boasted features like a cross-flow head, overhead cams working four valves per cylinder, and twin plugs in each cylinder. The company delivered the first production model in 1921, then went racing and won the second edition of Le Mans in 1924. That is how Bentley began to become ""Bentley, ahem ..."", and here we are. Next year, on July 10, the company plans to celebrate the feat appropriately.</p>",magefan_blog/car-blog02.jpg,,,1
"Behind the scenes of the Porsche 911 Turbo 993 'Project Gold' with Porsche's restoration manager",behind-the-scenes-of-the-porsche-911-turbo-993-project-gold-with-porsches-restoration-manager,car,,"<p>Porsche unveiled a special continuation model at this year's Monterey Car Week called Project Gold, a 1998 Porsche 911 Turbo 993. And while it may look as though it was simply a 993 given a flashy coat of paint and corresponding interior, the story is more complicated than that, as we learned from Porsche's factory restoration manager, Uwe Makrutzki. In reality, it's the most carefully, obsessively built 993 to come out of Porsche.</p>
<p>First some background on the project. Makrutzki told us that the first discussions for Project Gold began about two and a half years ago, and they began because of a confluence of happenings at Porsche. Porsche's 70th anniversary of car building was coming up, and Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur had just launched its own special vehicle, the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series. Porsche Classic, the department that handles restorations, was wanting to do something special, too, inspired by the Exclusive Series 911. Fortunately for the department, they noticed that there was still a complete, bare production-line 993 chassis built in 1994 that nothing had been done with. All of this led to the start of Project Gold.</p>
<p>For a bit over a year and a half, the Porsche restoration team was working on the car. The team decided that they wanted it to very much be a 993 with similar specifications to the original, rather than an over-the-top show car. This is why it has a twin-turbo 3.6-liter Turbo S 993 engine, and not something more powerful from a newer 911. That doesn't mean there wouldn't be any upgrades to the car, though. The chassis did start as a plain 911 Turbo, not a Turbo S, and it lacked the fender intakes of the higher-spec car. The team wanted to add them, which turned out to be quite difficult as there was no tooling to add the intake inlets after the body had been built. So those intakes were added by hand, and to ensure they were properly shaped and sized, Porsche brought in people that worked on the 993 production line to help inspect and re-create them.</p>
<p>The attention to detail didn't stop there. Makrutzki told us that although Project Gold's engine is technically a stock Turbo S engine rated at 450 horsepower, it's probably one of the better examples. The team took the engine apart and replaced the various internals such as the pistons and rods with the lightest examples they could find in stock. The engine was also ever so slightly bored during the rebuild. Makrutzki said the same method of picking the best components at Porsche Classic was also used for the 6-speed manual transmission. The suspension also sees a slight upgrade with the shocks. The original 993 shocks had been out of production for a while and unavailable, so Porsche used more modern shocks, and fitted them with original-style casings.</p>",magefan_blog/car-blog03.jpg,,,1
"Lexus showing two concept cars at Pebble Beach",lexus-showing-two-concept-cars-at-pebble-beach,car,,"<p>Lexus is readying itself for the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, and for the occasion, the carmaker is introducing a new concept version of the LC in a striking color scheme.</p>

<p>The Flare Yellow exterior paint is coupled with dark, forged alloy 21"" wheels and a carbon fiber roof. The yellow color continues on the inside, as the alcantara door panels match the outside. The leather seats also feature yellow stitching, as do the instrument panel, the center console and the glovebox.<p>

</p>The yellow car is the second stage in the Lexus LC Inspiration Series, and it was preceded by a blue LC500 in October 2017. Well, we say blue, but Lexus claimed the special paint itself had no blue pigment, and the impression of color was just the product of nano-structures embedded in the paint, which reportedly took eight months to produce. With the yellow paint, there are no such claims, but we wouldn't be surprised if Lexus told us it was made from crushed yellow pearls.<p>

<p>In addition to the yellow LC concept, Lexus is also displaying a customized version of the UX 250h. The VIP Auto Salon-built UX, wrapped in blue, comes with exterior enhancements together with a sportier suspension and exhaust setup, as well as a custom bike rack that holds a Lexus F Sport road bike.</p>",magefan_blog/car-blog04.jpg,,,1
"New Rockler Super-Sized Silicone Project Mat XL",new-rockler-super-sized-silicone-project-mat-xl,mechanic-tools,,"<p>Over at Rockler, they came out with a new super-sized version of their silicone project mat. The “project mat XL” is 23-1/2″ wide x 30-1/4″ long, which they say is ideal for standard-sized workbenches.&gt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>The mat is easy to clean, since wet glue rinses off and dried glue peels off. It’s also soft, and textured on the top so that it can trap debris that could otherwise scratch or dent your project.</p>

<p>There is a non-textured zone that serves as a small screw or fastener trap.</p>
<p>Since silicone is also heat-resistant, you can use this when working with hot glue guns as well.</p>
<p>The XL project mats also feature interlocking ribs on the ends, face down on one size, and face up on the other. This means that you can create seamless connections for extending the protective matting across a larger work surface.</p>

<p>Lastly, it can also be used for other applications, not just glue-ups. Rockler adds that the mat also works great as a sanding pad, helping to protect your workpiece while also holding it in place.</p>
<p>And of course it could just be used as a reusable protective work mat, for the garage, workshop, or even the dining room table.</p>",magefan_blog/blog-01.jpg,,,1
"New Bosch Colt GKF125CE Router is Coming Soon",new-bosch-colt-gkf125ce-router-is-coming-soon,mechanic-tools,,"<p>If you buy something through our links, ToolGuyd might earn an affiliate commission. Bosch GKF125CE Colt Router</p>
<p>The new Bosch GKF125CE Colt palm router has earned the title of “longest tool tease,” at least as far as handheld woodworking tools go.</p>
<p>We first wrote about it 2 YEARS ago, after a reader caught sight of a Lowes.com product listing. A new listing popped up a few months ago, but it was only today that Bosch officially announced it.</p>
<p>So what happened? I’m guessing that it was an in-development product that Lowes’ datafeed somehow picked up on early, or something like that. It was surely delayed, and since it was only officially announced today, we probably won’t ever find out why.</p>
<p>Since it’s been 2 years, and more information has been made available, it’s worth taking a new look at the router. You might think that corded palm routers aren’t very exciting, but I’ve been particularly eager to see this one launch.</p>
<p>It features a 1.25 hp (MAX) 7.0A motor, and ergonomic and soft-grip design. Electronic features include variable-speed controls (16,000-35,000 RPM), soft-start circuitry for reduced start-up torque, and constant response circuitry to help maintain speed under load.</p>
<p>The 1/4″ router is bundled with a PR101 fixed-base housing which can accommodate bits up to 1-5/16″ wide. Bosch has confirmed that the previous generation Bosch Colt router bases will NOT work with the new GKF125CE router. An optional plunge base will be available in 2018.</p>
<p>As hinted by the early product listing, there’s a user-friendly depth-adjustment system, and it has both inch and metric scales, for greater precision.</p>
<p>Motor removal is “push-button easy.”</p>
<p>There’s an LED work light.</p>
<p>Additional features include a shaft lock and included collet wrench. The cord is fixed to the router using a ball-joint, allowing it to swivel for easier maneuvering of the cord.</p>
<p>Bosch’s Colt router has been a hugely popular model, and for a long time. I find myself easily trusting that Bosch designed the GKF125CE to be a worthwhile upgrade. At the least, it’s more powerful. At best, it’s more powerful and has several years of ergonomics research contributing to superior user-friendliness.</p>
<p>The previous/current generation model, PR20EVS, is rated at 1 hp and 5.6A, compared to the new one’s 1.25 hp and 7.0A motor rating. It’s less expensive though, at $99 for the router compared to the new one’s $129 price. There’s also an established accessories ecosystem supporting it. A plunge base for the GKF125CE will be out soon, and I anticipate that it won’t be long before its accessory lineup matches that of the PR20EVS.</p>
<p>The best news, though, is that the router is REAL, and it’s coming out soon.</p>
<p>Price: $129 for the router (GKF125CE), $139 for the kit (GKF125CEK) ETA: Acme Tools mentions a December 30th release date</p>
<p>The kit version includes a carrying case and straight-edge guide.</p>",magefan_blog/blog_04.jpg,,,1
"Skilsaw “Buzzkill” Reciprocating Saw Tools",skilsaw-“buzzkill”-reciprocating-saw-tools,mechanic-tools,,"<p>Skilsaw sent me a rather cryptic email in mid-August, directing me to a teaser video and newsletter sign-up page for a new tool they were coming out with.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10 days later, they announced the new tool, their new Skilsaw Buzzkill reciprocating saw, which they claim provides “up to 35%” more vibration suppression over competing models.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A corded recip saw that promises lower vibration? Sounds good to me, although I haven’t been won over just yet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new Skilsaw Buzzkill, SPT44A-00, is Skilsaw’s debut into the linear cutting market, although it should be noted that there are plenty of Skil-branded entry-level and consumer models available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If your recall, Skil and Skilsaw were acquired by Chervon, from Bosch. Before that, Skilsaw sought to relaunch their brand identity separate from Skil, presumably to hone their “for pros” image, separate from Skil’s more entry-level and consumer-focused reputation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of Skilsaw’s forays into new markets, such as with their worm drive table saw, bear strong resemblances to Bosch tools. With this being a new release post-Bosch ownership, I wonder if it’s an entirely independently-designed product from under Chervon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Skilsaw’s marketing video and imagery excludes any competing Bosch saw. Does that mean Bosch’s saws are better, or are they excluding Bosch’s saws as a courtesy, perhaps because they had a hand in the design?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chervon is not a household name, but you have probably seen their tools before. They manufacture for many tool brands, including Craftsman and Kobalt. They also launched the EGO cordless outdoor power tool line in recent years, as well as Hammerhead, which doesn’t seem to have reached the same level of success.</p>
<p>This new Skilsaw Buzzkill reciprocating saw sports some fancy-sounding features:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Single-wobble drive train for reduced friction to slow heat buildup, contributing to longer tool life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Linear system for superior vibration control with fewer wear points.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Clock spring brush system with a constant spring designed for durability and optimal motor performance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A single wobble drivetrain? How many “wobbles” are in other saw’s drivetrains? The linear system is said to “simplify the counterbalance” for fewer wear points and greater durability. How?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A clock spring, as I understand it, works similarly to the coil return springs in drill presses and tape measures. I can’t visualize how that’s being used to press the carbon brushes to the motor, but Skilsaw claims benefits of durability and optimial motor performance.</p>",magefan_blog/tools-blog_01.jpg,,,1

<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Not knowing much about cable stapling options, but having witnessed a couple of wiring jobs, this looks like a convenient new tool to add to an electrician’s tool kit.</p>
<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">It seems great that there’s a single 1″ fastener size that can work with a range of Romex wire and even low voltage cables.</p>
<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">But that new special staple gives me something else to think about. At the moment, Dewalt is still finalizing retail partnerships, but I’m told that the new staples will be widely available at independent distributors and other retailers. My concern is this – what happens if you need a new box of staples ASAP, and your local supplier doesn’t carry the staples?</p>
<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">From the response I received from Dewalt, it seems that they’re all but promising me that an electrician can find more staples quickly and easily. Their assurance, and the fact that there’s a one-size-fits-all staple, has me cautious, but pretty much convinced.</p>
<p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Of course, the staples will likely be widely available online. But being a proprietary form factor, I’m thinking of scenarios where an electrician might leave their last box of staples at a job, in the wrong tool bag or van, or if they simply miscalculate how many they might need for a job and need a fast resupply.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Here’s what those Dewalt DRS1800 staples look like. It seems to me that the stapler has one power level, and the plastic cable shield prevents over-pressure situation that could restrict, crush, or damage, non-metallic cabling.</span></p>",magefan_blog/blog_02.jpg,,,1
